- Intro into functions and arguments
- Create a function named evenSumN that calculates the sum of even numbers from 1 to N (N specified by the user)
- Call evenSumN in the main function

## Test: Guess the Number Game 🎲 <a name="test"></a>

Write a guess the number game program that generates a random number and gets user input number, compares them, and tells the user if the number is too high or too low from the random number specified by the program until the user gets the number right. Show a message in the end containing the correct number and the attempts it took the user to guess the number right!

### Key Points Covered:

- Git and GitHub commands (pull, push, commit)
- C language fundamentals
- `stdio.h` functions (`printf`, `scanf`)
- `main` function
- Data types (`int`, `float`, `char`)
- Operators (`+, /, -, %`)
- Arrays, strings, and string functions (`strcpy`)
- Loops (`for` loop)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Functions and function arguments
